//// The client's HTTP seam: a generic JSON `get`, the `login` POST, the operations

//// Identity is now SERVER-side (issue #6): `login` authenticates the chosen
//// identity and the server replies with a signed session cookie. The browser then
//// carries that cookie on every same-origin request, so `submit_operation` no
