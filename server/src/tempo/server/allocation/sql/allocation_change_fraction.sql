-- allocation_change_fraction.sql — Change: re-fraction from a date onward. FOR
-- PORTION OF sets the new fraction + audit_id on [$3, row.upper); PG re-inserts the
-- [row.lower, $3) leftover at the old fraction keeping its original audit_id. The
-- `@> $3` filter excludes a scheduled future version. $1 = engineer_id,
-- $2 = project_id, $3 = effective, $4 = new fraction, $5 = audit_id.
