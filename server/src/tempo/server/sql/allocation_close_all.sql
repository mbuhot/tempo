-- allocation_close_all.sql — Cascade: cap ALL of an engineer's allocations.
--
-- Used by `terminate_employment` as the allocation step of the child-first cascade.
-- `DELETE … FOR PORTION OF allocated_during FROM $2 TO NULL` wipes every future
-- allocation fact for the engineer from $2 onward: spanning rows are capped to
-- [row.lower, $2) and fully-future rows are dropped. The omitted @> filter is
-- deliberate — terminate is intentionally broad across all projects.
--
-- $1 = engineer_id, $2 = end day (scalar date, cast in SQL).
DELETE FROM allocation
   FOR PORTION OF allocated_during FROM $2::date TO NULL
 WHERE engineer_id = $1;
