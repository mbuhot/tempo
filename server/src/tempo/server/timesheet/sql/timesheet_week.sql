-- timesheet_week.sql -- an engineer's whole Mon-Sun week: every project allocated on
-- ANY day of the week, with each day's allocation coverage and any hours logged. One
-- row per (project, day). $1 = engineer_id, $2 = the Monday of the week; the week is
-- the half-open range [$2, $2 + 7). 'allocated' is the cell's editability: an
-- allocation to this project covers that day AND the engineer is not on leave that day
-- (leave takes precedence, as on the old single-day form). The grid disables a cell
-- where it is false; the timesheet_within_allocation PERIOD FK backstops the same rule
-- on write.
